# Templify

A small CLI utility to use any GitHub repo as a template for your project.

## How to Use

Simply call the executable with the URL of the repository you want to use as a template and the tool will download the latest version of the main branch into the working directory and initialize it as a new repository.

```bash
./templify.exe https://github.com/bmorrisondev/faunaservice
```

You can optionally specify a different directory as well.

```bash
# This will create a folder called 'my-new-project' with the contents of the source repo
templify https://github.com/bmorrisondev/faunaservice my-new-project
```

## Contributing

To contribute, follow standard GitHub contribution guidelines:

3. Create a pull request.
4. ???
5. Profit! (Not really...)
